A remake of the 1990s Atari game, Rampart, made for my Software Engineering class at UC Davis.  


Instructions on how to run it are available [here](http://marshallhampson.com/fortnitta/).


The current code is not functional at the moment because some graphics and sounds used in the class are copywritten.
